To add your content to `doorsofparis` please make sure to read through these guidelines. They are really short. Like, really short. This introduction paragraph is probably longer than the actual guidelines (without the code part that takes up a lot of space). So if you made it through this text here, you're already more than halfway to the end! Phu... Good job. So, let's have an apple and then sprint to the finish line.

## Doors
The door on the picture should be the main thing, subjectively pretty and (arguably) a door. Stretch this definition if you want to, but don't break it.

Make sure you have the rights to post the picture, add **color**, **latitude** and **longitude**, **location description** and finally also the **path to your image file**, like so:

```js
{
	color: "brown",
	lat: 48.853397,
	lon: 2.348784,
	location: "best view of door 0",
	image: "images/door000000.jpg"
}
```

Please name the image `+1` from the last submitted image, in the following scheme:

- previous picture was named `door000001.jpg`
- yours should be named `door000002.jpg`

If you're the person who legitimately submits `door999999.jpg` make sure to keep your schedule free for the following weekend. Because we'll have a party! ðŸŽ‰

## Code
Sure. Anything that makes this app more awesome and doesn't break things is welcome. Bring it. :)
